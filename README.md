### About the Assignment.

IIn this project, I created some employee and manager classes, respectively. The primary class employee has permissions
that are inherited by the manager class. The manager differs in having higher privileges as opposed to regular employees.
The function to delete books, reset passwords, and create profiles for the staff is granted to the manager. The files created for the project are in the index.html file and Employees.js. There was a lot of mistakes with the original file. The new file NewEmployees.js is the correction to the original file.
